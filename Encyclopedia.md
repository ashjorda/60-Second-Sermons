**Intro**

Welcome to Ridgeview Student Ministries, we are so glad youâ€™re here, I hope you are blessed in the Lord this evening. Tonight, I'm going to open up with a story about an Encyclopedia, and how we are living in a time of where reputation matters more than truth.

When I was growing up, we had a full set of encyclopedia set. Static information, that if it changed. You had to buy a whole new set. Not as prolific as today's internet age. Where you can publish changes at the speed of light on a publication or piece of text. Though when it comes to truth, I'd think we would agree it should stay the same throughout the end of time. Think about it, would you rather build your worldview on ever-changing "truths" or a single truth? A world view that is ever-changing will keep you in constant flux, and at some point make you numb to what is truth is and what you should believe. Which means you have to change how you gauge what is real. It appears today, we are more prone to bases on the reputation of the person delivering it versus the validity of the facts surrounding the claims.

**The Point**
There is at least one book, that has many translations. But its underlying truth remains the same. And it's the only book that has the power to transform our view of from a physical one to a spiritual one. As most of us may know, what happens in the world is a physical manifestation of what is going on in the spiritual realm. And based on this, may we always come back to the bible when we are seeking truth, answers, joy, and fulfilment for our spirits. As the reputation of the Divine, inspired word of God has never returned void. 

**Bible Verse**
John 4:1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God; 3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God; this is the spirit of the antichrist, of which you have heard that it is coming, and now it is already in the world. 4 You are from God, little children, and have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. 5 They are from the world; therefore they speak as from the world, and the world listens to them. 6 We are from God; he who knows God listens to us; he who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.


**Conclusion**
Let us be sure that we test all things, before we accept them as truth. And don't let reputation be the merit in which we judge what is fact or fiction.
