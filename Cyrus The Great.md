According to the ancient historian Herodotus, Cyrus the Great, the founder of the Persian Empire, executed an innovative strategy by redirecting the watercourse of the Euphrates River with a man-made canal. This shrewd tactic enabled his troops to march through the riverbed and conquer Babylon, overthrowing the reign of King Belshazzar in 539 BC. By doing so, Cyrus and his army entered the city without the need to breach its walls. The Babylonians, complacent in their defenses, failed to secure the river, leaving them unprepared for the Persian army's unexpected assault. The diversion of the Euphrates is widely considered a remarkable ancient engineering and military achievement, which helped establish the Persian Empire as a dominant force in the region.

**The Point**

As Christains, it's important as individuals that we do our part. In ensuring we are always protecting ourselves with the Armor of God as stated in Ephesians 6. This Armor is free, and we are called to put it on daily. As not only to protect our hearts, but our minds also. Considering the Devil knows all our weaknesses, and he will never stop trying to exploit them to keep us separated from our creator. Considering when we are out of sync with God, we are succeptable to the things Brian talked about at the winter retreat, such as sexual sin, false identity, etc. 

**Bible Verse**

Ephesians 6:11-18 ESV
11 Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. 12 For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms. 13 Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand. 14 Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place, 15 and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace. 16 In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. 17 Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
18 And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. 

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, when we pratice putting on the Armor of God. And we also decide to keep good company, by hanging with those who do the same. It can be said that we create something similar to the testudo (tortise) formation. Which is an ancient roman solider formation that consisted of soliders holding shields in front of them, and others holding them on their side, and also those standing in the middle of the formation holding the shileds over their head. This made them an impentrable force while in battle. So be sure you are putting on your Armor daily, and joining others to defeat the enemy.
