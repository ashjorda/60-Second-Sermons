**Intro**

Welcome to Ridgeview Student Ministries, we are so glad you’re here, I hope you are blessed in the Lord this evening. Tonight, I’m going to open us up with what some may call a 60 second sermon. A little more than 60 seconds, but something short and impactful hopefully . I recently heard an illustration by Tony Evans that I want to share with you all.

How many of you all know the basics of Baseball? Which base is the most important? If you said 1st base, you are right. As if you hit the ball, and skip first base and run to 2nd, 3rd and home. You will be tagged out, because if you don’t touch first, the other bases don’t matter. 
In our lives, and most Christians might agree. Not enough of us touch first base often enough before we try to goto 2nd, 3rd or home plate in our own power. We wrestle with feelings that contradict what God says about us. We see the world through a lens in which God didn’t intend for us to, and we just see chaos and disorder. Our relationships aren’t what we expect them to be, life just doesn’t seem to be fair or panning out how we think it should. 
Have we ever thought that this might be due to miss-alignment in our priorities? The things we consider important over others that are more important. 

**The Point**

If you haven’t figured it out by now what first base is. It’s simple, it’s Jesus Christ. Imagine that if every day when we wake up, when we are going about our day, when we are faced with tough decisions. Before we react and start running for 2nd, 3rd, and home plate. What if we stopped at 1st base. How much sweeter would the outcome be, because first and foremost the other bases would count. But we would also be in alignment with our calling as human beings from God. 

**Bible Verse**

Matthew 6:25-27 25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?

Matthew 6:33 33 ”But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.”

**Conclusion**

As I prepare to close, I think we can all agree that first base is equally important in our lives, as it is in baseball. As God’s promises never returns void, more so when we are in obedience to his word. God can do many things, but one thing he can’t do is be 2nd, 3rd or last in our lives. He has to be first in all things. As we prepare for worship, and to receive the message from Brian tonight. Let us touch first base by giving reverence to God through our singing and listening to words spoken to us.
