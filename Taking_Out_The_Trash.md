**Intro**

Welcome to Ridgeview Student Ministries, we are so glad you’re here, I hope you are blessed in the Lord this evening. Tonight, I’m going to open us up with a short illustration/bible verse. A little more than 60 seconds, but something short and impactful hopefully. I recently heard an illustration by Tony Evans when I was reading a devotional. Thought it was relevant to what Brian was preaching on last week out of John.  


**Illustration**

How many of you are responsible for taking out the trash in your house? 

**The Point**

If you haven’t figured it out by now what first base is. It’s our relationship with Jesus Christ. Imagine that if every day when we wake up, we would consider that a Homerun.  Then we run to first base, then we tackle our day by running to 2nd, 3rd, and home plate. How much sweeter would the outcome of our day be? Because first and foremost, the other bases would count. And our day would be in alignment with our calling from God. 

**Bible Verse**

Matthew 6:25-27 25 “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothes? 26 Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? 27 Can any one of you by worrying add a single hour to your life?

Matthew 6:33 33 ”But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.”

**Conclusion**

I think we can all agree that first base is equally important in our lives, as it is in baseball. As God’s promises never return void! And when we are in obedience to his word. God can do many things, but one thing he can’t be is 2nd base, 3rd base or home plate in our lives. He has to be first in all things. As we prepare to worship, and to receive the verbal living word of God. Let us touch first base by giving reverence to God through our singing and listening to Pastor Brian tonight.
