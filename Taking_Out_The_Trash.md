**Intro**

Welcome to Ridgeview Student Ministries, we are so glad you’re here, I hope you are blessed in the Lord this evening. Tonight, I’m going to open us up with a short illustration/bible verse. A little more than 60 seconds, but something short and impactful hopefully. I recently heard an illustration by Tony Evans when I was reading a devotional. Thought it was relevant to what Brian was preaching on last week out of John.  


**Illustration**

How many of you are responsible for taking out the trash in your house? What day is trash pickup? In my neighborhood, it's on thursdays. And my family is so kind to have the trash in the kictehn overflowing, letting me know I need to take it out, because they wont. *grins* So every wedenseday night, I make it my mission to ensure the trash is on the curb before 6:00 AM the next day. Because if its' not, the trash man won't pick it up. And not sure about you, but the trash man has never knocked on my door to have me open the garage so he could take my trash can and empty it. And overflowying trash in the garage, even when it's cold outside doesn't smell good. Especially not in the summer *pewwww*

**The Point**

Now, just like the trash man requires action. So does Jesus! Too often we carry around alot of trash, and we never take it out. And at somepoint, it starts to smell, which shows up in our actions, how we carry ourselves, and somtimes how we speak and treat others. It could be stress, uncertaintiy, worry about things we can't change, our identity or the feeling that you did something that you feel is 100% unforgiveable. The Good News is this, Jesus is also a trash man. And instead of having to pay to him picked up this type of trash, he says "Bring it to me, and I will give you rest". 

**Bible Verse**

Matthew 11:28-30 ESV
28 Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. 30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”

**Conclusion**

Pastor Matt mentioned a word in his Sunday sermon. The word was entrophy, which means in a state of dissary or disorder. Entrophy can/will show up in our lives if we don't address it. So my message to you all is this, ensure you aren't living a life of entrhopy, and make sure  you are taking out the trash not only in your house but also in your life often. Because Jesus said, "Come to me".
